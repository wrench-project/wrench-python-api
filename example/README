WRENCH Python API examples:

  - simple_simulator: a simulator that illustrates basic use of the WRENCH workflow API, building a workflow from scratch;
  - json_workflow_simulator: similar to the simulator above, but imports a workflow from a JSON file in the [WfFormat format](https://github.com/wfcommons/WfFormat);
  - compound_job_simulator: a simulator that illustrates base use of the WRENCH action API.
and can be executed as follows. In


Before running any of these examples, in a terminal start the `wrench-daemon` as:

```
wrench-daemon
```

(use `wrench-daemon --help` to see command-line options)

In another terminal, run the example simulators as:

```
python3 ./simple_simulator/simulator.py

python3 ./json_workflow_simulator/simulator.py

python3 ./compound_job_simulator/simulator.py
```
